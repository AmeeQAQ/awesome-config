# My Awesome WM setup
Repo to upload the config files used in my Awesome WM setup that I use. 

It features VIM-like keybinds for workspace traversal, as well as client selection, that work really well with my minimal split keyboard, a pleasing color palette inspired by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) and retrowave, and a modern floating wibar setup that I think looks really great.

## Setup
Most of this config will work out of the box except the scripts. You can download those (#SOON) or make your own. Simply create lua files in the same fashion I did for my own scripts and call them in `ui/bar.lua`. After that, just add them at the right side by calling the new variable. You can easily do this by replacing my own code.
